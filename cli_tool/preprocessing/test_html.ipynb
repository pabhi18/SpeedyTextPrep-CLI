well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it's probably not unusual now. it's a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older james (or jim, as most people in the film say). for some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, i think, entirely appropriate.<br /><br />and that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly \\x96 although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants, i'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. a minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...<br /><br />which brings me to another criticism by others: the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. i'll admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words \\x96 until i realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. in short, it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...<br /><br />and what of the title? from shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so, if you equate god with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie \\x96 and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of david lean's doctor zhivago (1965) \\x96 is a useful metaphor. i tend to think, however, that cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants \\x96 the god-fearing salt of the earth \\x96 were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.<br /><br />was that cimino's intent \\x96 to gut the myth of the american west? to show how, in america, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? is that anything new? not really, as we all know. where it really hurt, however, is in showing how america was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...\",\n",

       " \"it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy, but survives. the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w. bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater. i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april, but i sincerely hope not many. it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. and then the sex scenes aren't even good! i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies. i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. the spice channel is more imaginative. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress, emi kuroda. otherwise, this is pure torture.\",\n",

       " 'if one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for harold lloyd. unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. he had a good voice which matched his image. moreover, from 1924 on, his \"silent\" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the fall frolic from the freshman and the monkey sequence in the kid brother). yet lloyd\\'s sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of welcome danger had ebbed. lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the glass character\\'s enemy was not sound but the great depression. pre-depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. compounding this problem of character choice is lloyd\\'s perception as an insincere glad hander. sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. the cat\\'s-paw fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of lloyd\\'s pro-fascist agenda. many film scholars believe that lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of fdr as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. demille had directed this day and age, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. we should also remember that america was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. tcp suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a \"comedy\" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in germany in that year. the production code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. the ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. for this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. ironically, the mere existence of tcp, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that fdr\\'s america was secure enough to accept criticism. one sees no parallel criticism in hitler\\'s germany, stalin\\'s ussr, or mussolini\\'s italy. but can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? lloyd\\'s unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by dr goebbels himself if he\\'d had a sense of humor, of course. it posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor by any means necessary, and does so with good nature and fun. impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, chaplin\\'s the great dictator. this latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. the great dictator produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the war: second, he never sold tcp to television. the post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn\\'t amusing.',\n",

(i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the ff7 game.)<br /><br />visuals - 10/10 i loved advent children. it's a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. the visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. when the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller-coaster. with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range, to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it's all hard to fault. the animation looks big budget, the style and imagery is awesome, and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage. i could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn't do it any justice.<br /><br />sound - 10/10 the sound was fabulous. the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. the music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack ever, transfered beautifully to the movie. most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie, albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on. there was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time.<br /><br />story - 7/10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again, the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. as far as the story goes, the plot wasn't bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. in effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. the game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development, that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. instead, the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. the lack of materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not zero) materia, and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. i would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. there were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of advent children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.<br /><br />characters - 7/10 the characters, whilst all being present in one form or another, don't necessarily shine to their true potential. there simply isn't really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. and so, all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased, and in some cases, barely at all (red and cait sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). even cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. the materia issue is a strong reason for this. with that said, it's a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest. the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.<br /><br />value - 10/10 the replay value for this movie is excellent - i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume.<br /><br />enjoyment - 10/10 whatever the flaws of the movie, they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it, and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people. i enjoyed advent children tremendously, and encourage fellow ff7 fans to go see it.\",\n",

(example: when a car breaks down, the owner yells at the passengers. then he says something to the effect of, \"sorry i yelled at you guys. you don\\'t know what it\\'s like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you\\'re five years old.\" wtf?) at the very end, it gets to be more than i can handle. involves a montage with bill clinton, and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. really, by this point, i was firmly re-living my drug experiences.<br /><br />highly recommended. 7/10.',\n",

       " 'snake island is one of those films that, whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity, makes one wish the film camera had never been invented. the real reason why plan 9 from outer space will hold onto its honoured title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is. it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see. snake island is the other kind of bad. snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating. a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping one-key typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. filmed entirely on location in south africa, the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered well-realised. many shots involving snakes consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi, puppets, or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs.<br /><br />william katt stars, if you can call it that, as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. coming along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly-defined characters. it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end, but katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent. the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open-mouthed gaping and darting one\\'s eyes about in every direction. the foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as bioforge. meanwhile, snakes continually explode or jump about at random. it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaust.<br /><br />of course, no z-grade horror or sci-fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress. as every woman in the cast, almost, gets their clothes off, the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy. but like all the worst piles, all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff. the sex scenes never eventuate, and the deaths of characters are so flat, so uninteresting, that the entire film becomes pointless. unless you consider watching william katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill-fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff. for the record, i don\\'t. i used to think that anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes. i was so very, very wrong. at least anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time. some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots i have worn.<br /><br />so we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely. the unrecognisable, lame cast are accounted for, as are poor audio and visual effects. the dialogue is so wretched, so ill-timed, that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many moons ago. unfortunately, where snake island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films. in essence, it forgets to be so bad that it is funny. it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak. compared to william katt\\'s performance in snake island, jon voight\\'s performance in anaconda was as oscar-worthy as russell crowe\\'s in gladiator. not that voight or katt are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this, you\\'re hard-pressed to say a single word naturally. listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. one\\'s mind tends to blank out the experience, primary as a self-defense mechanism.<br /><br />because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad, i gave snake island a two out of ten. my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good, but not bad enough to entertain. it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern. the proper way to spell \"crap\" is s-n-a-k-e-i-s-l-a-n-d.',\n",

why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.<br /><br />besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character.<br /><br />the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing?

       " 'i finally watched the third film in mehta\\'s trilogy: \"fire\". to begin, i\\'d say that \"water\" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality. fire: there is so much going on in this film that i\\'ll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. the writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of \"heat\" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships. <br /><br />mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from. india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. that she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of \"water\" after having had the script cleared, shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. worse, if someone like mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats. so, as much as india thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. whereas \"earth\" was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence, fire and water are pointing at personal, social and religious issues, which as i say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away. as i write this \"water\" is scheduled to actually be shown in india later this year. i\\'ll believe it when i see it. <br /><br />fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that i saw in \"a price above rubies\". whether it\\'s arranged marriages (which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago, or like it is among many modern indians), they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or, just plain loveless marriages..... however, this is not the real issue. mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (fire). i am no expert regarding either the secular or hindu laws concerning divorce. the film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage. in any case mehta\\'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern indian relationships up to probing scrutiny. that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack. i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough. superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.',\n",

       " 'hearkening back to those \"good old days\" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema. that\\'s what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody\\'s old talk show. (we can\\'t recall just whose it was; either merv griffin or woody woodbury, one or the other!) the guest talked about sir charles\\' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former \"little tramp\\' from los estados unidos on the grounds of his being an \"undesirable alien\". (no schultz, he\\'s not from another planet!) <br /><br />charlie had been deemed to be a \\'subversive\\' due to his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems. everything from the anarchist movement from the \\'20s (and before), the technocracy craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplin\\'s hollywood parties; which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style, which we commonly call communism.<br /><br />compounding mr. chaplin\\'s predicament was both confounded by one little detail. he had never become an american citizen.<br /><br />anyhow, enough of this background already! <br /><br />suffice it to say that he had become \\'persona non gratis\\' in the united states of america. .it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses. it\\'d sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting americanos.<br /><br />it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist; besides, the academy of motion pictures arts & sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show. this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world-wide television audience numbering in the millions. <br /><br />besides, that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre! (remember, the little tramp was as astute as a bu$ine$$ man as he was as a film maker!) the program consisted of showings of modern times, city lights, the great dictator, monseur verdoux, a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue. we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest.<br /><br />in our fair city of chicago, it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street. the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time, each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public\\'s desire to view each picture. as we recall, the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revue.<br /><br />in retrospect, we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue; as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (much like ourselves) who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures, except for those keystone, essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so, so many kiddy shows all over the country. oh well, once again, no one consulted me!<br /><br />concentrating on today\\'s honored guest film, the chaplin revue, we found that it was actually three separate pictures; carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin (himself), some lively themes and incidental music (once again written by chaplin) and some happy talk and serious narration (ditto, by chaplin.) he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie-type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood, as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time, showing director chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actors.<br /><br />this segment was well done and well received by the audience. both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated. (the rehearsal naturally, the building by use of speeding up the camera\\'s photographic process. the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves.<br /><br />this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplin\\'s short comedies from his stint with first national pictures.; roughly that being 1917 to 1923. the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood.<br /><br />first up was shoulder arms (charles chaplin productions/first national pictures, 1918). as the title suggests, it is a tale of world war i. released in october of 1918 with about a month to go before the armistice day of november 11, it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl (miss edna purviance). the levity is fast, physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy, the german army.<br /><br />displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together, the next film a dog\\'s life (chaplin productions/first national, 1918) traces the parallel lives of chaplin\\'s tramp and a newly adopted stray, scraps. the movie story involves families, two of them. one homo sapiens, one canine and both supplying us with some big surprises.<br /><br />as the finale, we have the pilgrim (chaplin/first national, 1923) was a good choice to have as the finale. it was bright, light and tight. it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof, comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team. the \"pilgrim\" in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety; but rather a \"dude\" or \"tenderfoot\", who has ventured out west. the tramp is not only that guy; but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western town\\'s church!<br /><br />our rating (that is schultz and me) is ****.

       " 'ken harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. end of story.<br /><br />\"end of story\", that is, in the sense of \"end of any physical action\". not in the sense of \"end of the film\". ken\\'s life is saved, but he is paralysed from the neck down. when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive. the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.<br /><br />ken\\'s main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, michael emerson. although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular ones. if dr emerson has any deep religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. he believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty. ken therefore finds himself in a \"catch-22\" situation. he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. emerson, however, considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. ken\\'s dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.<br /><br />richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that \"whose life is it anyway?\" simply does not work as a film. at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. when plays were filmed, therefore, the general tendency was to \"open them up\" by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright\\'s text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.<br /><br />i have never seen brian clarke\\'s play, but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema. there is very little physical action; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed. such a plot does not lend itself to the \"opening up\" device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. although it is well written and there is some good acting, i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject. 4/10',\n",

       " 'a blaxploitation classic, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the \"toasts\" that rudy ray moore performs. toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. for more on toasts, rudy ray moore, and why this movie is important, go to dolemite.com.<br /><br />which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. this movie packs in a great deal of \"laugh-at-the-funny-outfits-and-hairstyles\" bang for the buck, as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue. it starts as dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice. i was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but that\\'s me, i\\'m a neophyte in the prison scene. he is helped in this by queen bee, who is dolemite\\'s lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he\\'s been gone. she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters.<br /><br />i watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. the first part i watched on my lunch break while exercising, and wasn\\'t enjoying it much at all. it struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation, with a ludicrous story, shoddy craftsmanship\\x97well, i guess that makes it sound like it had some craftsmanship\\x97and tons of outrageous locales, outfits and dialogue. but i wasn\\'t enjoying that\\x97in fact, it kind of made me feel dirty. let\\'s face it, a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist: how ridiculously those black people dress, what silly things they say. i wasn\\'t really enjoying it, wasn\\'t laughing, and wasn\\'t looking forward to watching the rest.<br /><br />later that night, when i was in a \"much more relaxed state,\" i watched the rest\\x97and legitimately loved it. like disco godfather, which i had watched a few days previously, this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it\\'s silly or violent. the character of dolemite has an element of self-parody about him that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in disco godfather implies that we\\'re watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together. even the poor dubbing, karate fights, and everything else just makes it that much more charming.<br /><br />what i find interesting about the dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity i don\\'t see in other blaxploitation films, and certainly in very few mainstream films. in this one, there is an african-american woman who gives a speech about the (white) mayor, saying \"he has done more for the black community than anyone.\" we later find out that the mayor is, surprise, corrupt, but i like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to \"redeem\" her in some other way. there\\'s also the figure of the hamburger pimp, who is presented as a useless junkie, and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming, socially positive angle to what he is, he just is. in disco godfather the religious character lady reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to angel dust. i like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar-coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable.<br /><br />there are a lot of hootworthy elements, such as when dolemite says \"move over and let me pass, or i\\'m gonna be pulling these hush puppies out your muthatf** a**.\" there is queen bee reaching over and answering the phone: \"dolemite\\'s total experience.\" and you will not be able to miss (though you may wish to cover your eyes) the extended nude scene by the repulsive mayor. i am all for mustachioed pervy older men, but even i have limits\\x97-and my limits are usually a few miles past most people\\'s, so be warned. the dvd i had is clearly edited, which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes, and at the end, when dolemite\\'s killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event.<br /><br />if you do get the dvd, however, be sure to watch all three trailers for the dolemite films, as they are a hoot. i wasn\\'t going to watch the human tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you\\'d better believe that i am. also, there is a scene in the dolemite trailer that i don\\'t remember from the movie when dolemite swings at a mexican-looking thug, obviously misses, and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk.<br /><br />after watching the first half, i was going to say to skip this and watch disco godfather, as the film-making and story has marginally improved, but after really enjoying the second half, i would advise watching this one over disco godfather, as this one is even more exuberantly fun, outrageous, and good-natured\\x97and has those toasts which, even if one doesn\\'t understand the roots and nuances of the form, are still something to see.<br /><br />--- check out other reviews on my website of

       " 'warning: may contain spoilers<br /><br /> the ripples in the wake of the first \"jaws\" movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond. movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie: the ocean, deep space, genetics). although \"jaws\" was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror, few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original. \"shark rosso nell\\'oceano\" (aka devil fish or red ocean), is a dutiful follower of the original \"jaws\" formula. after several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature, there is an initial drive to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results, and a final push to destroy it. although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing, brittle acting, and cheap scares.<br /><br /> the most sickly compelling feature of \"devil fish\" is its cookie-cutter editing. from the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together, the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility. it appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music. furthermore, every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms \"fade\", \"wipe\", or \"dissolve\". the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins. silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies.<br /><br /> the music is equally bland. the creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the \"jaws\" theme with slight variation. although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence, mike most aptly described the somber score as \"soft core porn music\". failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to \"devil fish\". the acting is stale, the relationships baffling, and the whole conspiracy is laughable. the question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn\\'t a more practical use be administered to better mankind? one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster, even though its film presence is less than stellar.<br /><br /> overall, this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre. if \"jaws\" had never been made, then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively. sadly, as a carbon copy of spielberg\\'s original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese.',\n",

       " \"this is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to 'poltergeist'. i saw 'one dark night' when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked.<br /><br />i was born in 1963, so i have a certain love for '80's horror films, despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written. what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of 'psychic vampirism' has not been addressed (at least, to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon.<br /><br />i didn't care if adam west was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought meg tilly was good casting. the little-known donald hutton (from 'brainstorm' and 'invaders from mars') as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramar's abilities was sadly overlooked. as a gay guy, i was paying more attention to david mason daniels, meg tilly's unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend. he's selling real estate in texas now. <br /><br />i felt the film 'realistic' in two ways: raymar, who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was sparse in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. as you know, these types are buried without fanfare. second, if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking, groaning, arms out-stretched zombies, but opted for what would be believable. kudos! the buzzing electrical discharge from ramar's eyes at his 'throne coffin' (like he's overseeing his kingdom of dead), cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! if you've ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows. don't get me started on the cavernous silence. even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. the score was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out. the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be. i especially liked the carefully-planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall thin black guy, and the half-faced world war ii vet, and the green-slimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the 'sisters' clique initiators. even corpses can be good actors, i suppose. the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julie's boyfriend couldn't possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it's stomach and feet first, but why? it looked a little to fresh too.<br /><br />the film begins eerie, with us never seeing ramar's face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughter's psychic flash. we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he's experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall. the rest does drag as the heathers-like 'sisters' group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed build up to the unleashing horror later. the movie isn't bloody in any sense of the word. the goriest part is when ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him, and he bubbles then melts. i've always felt that a power like ramar's could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into. i can see it now: one dark night ii: turning in the grave. but let's face it-the film stands alone. i heard the film had other titles, but the original fits.<br /><br />a remake would be pointless. but if there were to be one, i would write better dialog, and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramar's abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. in this information age, something like that would be well documented on dvd. and more corpses! why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramar's power could spread to the graveyard too? let's just say i'd hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that too can be shown. i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character. with cg effects, some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall! <br /><br />say what you will about,'one dark night' but it has it all. so see at least once in your life...or death!\",\n",

       " 'linda blair has been acting for forty years now, and while she will never escape the part of regan macneil in \"the exorcist\", few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as \"witchery\" does. she plays jane brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (catherine hickland and rick farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (david hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (leslie cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (hildegard knef). it seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was with child at the time. unaware of the danger, jane has recently dreamt of the witch\\'s dramatic death, and jane\\'s little brother tommy (michael manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky, black-clad spirit, which he calls \\'the lady in black\\'. the group\\'s time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them, however, the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (george stevens). before long, the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror. she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she haunts them one by one in gruesome, horrifying ways. the island location is effectively scary, and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. it\\'s such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argento\\'s work. the lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. the soundtrack is very effective and unique. the horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. the cinematography is great, and it is this that brings us back to linda blair. the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups that subtly detail jane\\'s incremental possession, and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. there are hidden homages to \"rosemary\\'s baby\", \"jacob\\'s ladder\", \"the shining\", \"black sunday\", and of course \"the exorcist\". she does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. that isn\\'t to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; catherine hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as jane\\'s bitchy mother rose. hasselhoff gives it his best, but he is not essentially a film star, and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. the film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (blair also played a mother in 2003\\'s \"monster makers\", and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them). lastly, hildegard knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. along with blair, she was also perfectly cast. but it\\'s blair\\'s movie all the way. jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film hearkens back to \"exorcist ii: the heretic\". i think \"witchery\" is up there with \"the exorcist\", \"exorcist ii\", \"hell night\", and \"summer of fear\" as blair\\'s best genre work to date.',\n",

       " \"i recently attended sundance as i have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies, the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. but then i saw mark and michael polish's 'northfork' and i remembered why i so fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'northfork' sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of terence malick and the existential landscapes of antonioni. it's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. it reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films i saw this year. it is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most american movies. i plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. for it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a haunting work where one can roam the plains of montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. the cast performs this luminiscent piece with striking conviction particularly james woods and nick nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers. maybe 'northfork' will help us find a new wave of american cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception. see it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing 'northfork' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the polish brothers.\",\n",

       " \"with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's, charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer. in the great dictator, chaplin created a dead-on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. the film traces hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day. simultaneously, chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule.<br /><br />paulette goddard, chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto. jack oakie has a great, oscar-nominated supporting role as a mussolini look-alike (benzini napaloni) who gives chaplin's hitler character, adenoid hynkel, a lot of fits. henry daniell is his usual staid self as garbitsch, chief adviser to adenoid hynkel. chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. the film was also nominated for best picture.<br /><br />chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time. the film spent about twenty-one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. by the time of the film's release in october of 1940, the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.<br /><br />there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between hynkel and napaloni. the scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. likewise, the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for hynkel in order to give chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. on the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for hynkel? <br /><br />still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between hynkel and napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.\",\n",
       " '\"summer of my german soldier\" was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were \"brian\\'s song\", \"sybil\" and \"someone\\'s watching me!\"). it portrays a jewish girl (kristy mcnichol) befriending a german pow (bruce davison) in wwii-era georgia. one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren\\'t really nazis, but were just drafted. watching the movie, i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then; i mean, can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /><br />so, i certainly recommend this movie. i believe that it\\'s always important to show the things portrayed here. occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd. also starring esther rolle and michael constantine (the \"my big fat greek wedding\" patriarch).',\n",

       " \"david lynch shot his first film, 'erasurehead', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash. kevin smith made 'clerks' at work, while working as a clerk, and robert rodriguez has boasted that 'from dusk till dawn' cost precisely $30,000. but $30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. and what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries, and all the dorkishness of smith, but absolutely none of the talent. such a figure is mark borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years. borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that he's simply (on the evidence presented in 'american movie') not very good. and like a modern day ed wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers, his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature. the collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own hapless children and best of all his aged uncle bill. bill may live in a trailer park, and just about have given up on life, but he is the owner of a small fortune ($280,000 to be precise) and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film. borchardt manages to enlist a few actors to perform (alongside himself, of course) but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even bill has a role on camera). on british tv, the bbc brilliantly scheduled a screening of 'american movie' back-to-back with 'lost in la mancha', the story of terry gilliam's ill fated attempt to film 'don quixote'. in that film, one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display (inadequate as it was to the task in hand), and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film; whereas borschadt is not only penniless, but also such a clown that he can't even pronounce the name of his own work ('coven') properly. ultimately, borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. if this film was fiction, you'd dismiss it as unbelievable; but as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you're likely to see.\",\n",

(the offcie of emergency management) mike roark (tommy lee jones) decides to cut his holiday short & go in, once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the epicentre of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. mike isn't sure what to think so he brings geologist dr. amy barnes (anne heche) in to try & explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake & erupts at the la brea tar pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything & everything it touches in flames. mike, his men & the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava & save as many lives as possible...<br /><br />directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dante's peak (1997) being released a mere two months or so before volcano was & while dante's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it's slightly better & more plausible than volcano is. the script here is total nonsense & is not based in reality at all, underground rivers of lava that seem to appear & then disappear just as quick, various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat (when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine, as far as i am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) & it constantly happens, helicopters flying is clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava (what about down the other streets & other directions?), being able to blow a perfect trench in a street & then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam & when kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there & watches two firemen get burned to death & waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire, despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through & loads more besides like that massive building falling on tommy lee & his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. the character's are awful too although they were not as clichéd as usual with no romance blossoming between tommy lee & anne heche & minimal city official's who try to shut tommy lee & anne heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. there's a few badly written & at times embarrassing moral moments as los angeles pulls together, the black guy & that semi racist cop who warm to each other & by the end are wishing each other well & that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy & is surely a ham-fisted attempt & trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings & we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. having said that i think volcano is one of those so bad it's good films, it entertains & it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.<br /><br />i suppose a film like volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as the poseidon adventure (1972) or earthquake (1974) but on a huge budget with modern effects work. speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much & the set-pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, sure there are a few impressive explosions & a few ok river of lava flowing through los angeles effects but little else. generally volcano just isn't very exciting & while occasionally unintentionally funny & completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 it opened to a little under $15,000,000 at the box-office, it looks alright & there's lots of fire but nothing stands out & volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. filmed in los angeles i think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. the cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue & ridiculous set-pieces to contend with, tommy lee jones deserves better than this.<br /><br />volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. worth it for a few unintentional laughs & the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great & i doubt i would ever want to see it again.\",\n",

(the skill of current day australian & irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing.) the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes' definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.<br /><br />'oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'fat man & little boy' feature film with paul newman as leslie groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered) and dwight schultz (alumnus of tv's 'a-team') as oppenheimer. as a mini-series, 'oppenheimer' is around 4x as long as the newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.\",\n",

       " \"breaking dawn starts in a californian college as professor simon (associate producer joe morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in cape state hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail & they will never become qualified doctors. a bright, young, attractive & intelligent student named eve (kelly overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. his name is don wake (james haven) & is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (diane verona) & her young daughter (jenette mccurdy). at first don won't even look at eve much less talk to her, but like the trooper she is eve persists in trying to figure him out. eventually don begins to talk but what he says frightens eve, he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name malachay. eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn, as don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. is there something more to the supposed nonsense that don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?<br /><br />written & directed by mark edwin robinson i have nothing but negative feelings towards breaking dawn. now, we all like a good twist ending, the sort of ending which catches us unawares, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to the sixth sense (1999) & fight club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious. then, of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take, oh i don't know lets say breaking dawn because i have never seen such an awful ending to a film, never. breaking dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to eve, it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest, it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that bad a film until the twist ending, i have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was ok to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. i am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail, all i can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as i'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will. breaking dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history, it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br /><br />director robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play out ok or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but i'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. he builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.<br /><br />technically breaking dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. the acting is pretty good, overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. was it just me or did the guy who played don look like john morghen star of such italian sleaze classics as cannibal apocalypse (1980), city of the living dead (1980), the house on the edge of the park (1980), cannibal ferox (1981), stagefright (1987) & the church (1989)? ok, maybe it was just me...<br /><br />breaking dawn is rubbish, i hated it all because of the final few minutes. don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was ok. definitely one to avoid as far as i'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the imdb...\",\n",

(i said it in spite of that they made love in bed) however the cop, can\\'t stop with investigation, can\\'t stop close and can\\'t allow the woman close to him but he starts the \"love\", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. but it can\\'t. the woman realizes it. the end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.<br /><br />it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyote-i like this man\\'s face- sidney pollack. i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good.<br /><br />i think harrison ford did an okay job. his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament. it was pity he had not got any joke. but ford has got a good sense of humour. a reviewer noticed (in hungary): \"ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. but dr jones is not smiling at us\".. but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. with the rest i agree. i very like him in this role- he is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.the two cool, reserved- people find each other.<br /><br />maybe the script is not good. it is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man. it is a good film but not for everybody, not for the general big audience. i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better. about the latter, maybe sidney pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn\\'t go to multiplex. anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes, who like only ford\\'s action films miss this movie.',\n",

       " \"synopsis: andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, getting dropped off on a desert land, at what seems the last stop of his journey. he doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. after momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. he then enters a world different to the one he came from. <br /><br />as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. as he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. on this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. the strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. it is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. <br /><br />to help andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on andreas' mind all along. realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape. he seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?<br /><br />my thoughts: this norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! what is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man (or woman). it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. it tries to show that small cliché things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot. the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to. you start to adopt the saying of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.<br /><br />even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. the lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. the director, jens lien has put together a film, which in any other director's hands would have failed. this is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.<br /><br />the lead role, played by trond fausa aurvaag is perfectly cast. representing the average joe, trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. the supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.<br /><br />the score for this film was beautifully composed. the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.<br /><br />set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. this film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! it has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...a must -see!!\",\n",

(perhaps they fear a godzilla attack?). why is the head of anti-matter gathering a vatican priest? now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world\\x85 no just kidding; unfortunately the illuminati haven't quite grasped that pinky and the brain level of sophistication just yet. instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. the top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the illuminati are killing them one by one seven style. they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed riddler. oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time rick steves will have to go straight to venice next year to see decent frescoes. if only there was some latin themed batman to save the day\\x85? okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. a true character study\\x85 (okay you know where this is going). tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest israeli actress ayelet zurer has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen. ewan macgregor plays the pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms.<br /><br />on the plus side stellan skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of vatican security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its vatican critics in at least one area.\",\n",

       " 'clayton moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director lesley selander\\'s epic adventure \"the lone ranger and the lost city of gold,\" co-starring jay silverheels as his faithful indian scout tonto. selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit. this fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in hollywood oaters after director delmar daves blazed the trail with the james stewart western \"broken arrow.\" racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the robert schaefer and eric freiwald screenplay. having written 13 episodes of \"the lone ranger\" television series, schaefer and freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing. our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. the mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don\\'t have to guess what is happening.<br /><br />although the violence in this selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards, the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double-crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious. the television series never went to this length, and when the lone ranger wielded his six-gun, he shot the gun out of the villain\\'s fist rather than blow him away. the other discrepancy here is the indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman. douglas kennedy didn\\'t have the villainous statue of lyle bettger who menaced the masked man in director stuart heisler\\'s \"the lone ranger,\" but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful indians.<br /><br />\"the lone ranger and the lost city of gold\" opens with a recap of the masked protagonist\\'s origins as an ambushed texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with tonto serving as his sidekick. this opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character off to a start so that everybody, including non-lone ranger fans, is on equal footing. the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and called\\x97not surprisingly\\x97the hooded raiders begins with them killing indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. the lone ranger and tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. taking the baby and the dead indian, they ride to a nearby spanish mission supervised by padre vincente esteban (ralph moody of \"the outsider\") and turn the infant and body over to him. initially, the padre has to assure an indian maiden, paviva (lisa montell of \"gaby\"), that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend. padre sends tonto off to town to fetch the doctor, dr. james rolfe (dean fredericks of \"gun fever\"), and tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman, sheriff oscar matthison (charles watts of \"giant\"), who abhors indians. tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff\\'s jail and matthison\\'s men start to rough him up when rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission.<br /><br />eventually, the lone ranger and tonto are able to capture one of the hooded raiders, but an indian redbird (maurice jara of \"drum beat\"), and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village. they stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. chief villain ross brady (douglas kennedy of \"hell\\'s crossroads\") and his cohort william (lane bradford of \"devil\\'s canyon\") ride out to the village and brady uses his winchester to kill his captured henchman. little does brady know that his henchman talked. the lone ranger and tonto arrive not long afterward and reprimand redbird for his perfidy. redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the lone ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more. he masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent.<br /><br />despite its concise 83-minute running time, \"the lone ranger and the lost city of gold\" lacks neither excitement nor surprises. selander keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop. the dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as schaefer and freiwald push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises, but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good indian theme. there is also a scene where the lone ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when supreme court chief justice earl warren had embarked on the high court\\'s landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation, civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest procedure in the united states. one thing that differentiates \"the lone ranger and the lost city of gold\" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. generally, lone ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in european history. no, the lone ranger wasn\\'t the first movie to deal with spanish conquistadors. robert d. webb\\'s \"the seven cities of gold\" (1955) concerned the spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places, but selander\\'s western beat gordon douglas\\' \"gold of the seven saints\" (1961) to the screen.',\n",

(naturally dr. flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous, distracting boy.) to make a long (predictable) story short, adrienne helps dr. flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a \"routine\" cyst removal of the face). dr. flanner is finally able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by scott glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. \"i told him she was too old for that much juice!\" glenn\\'s character,(robert torrelson) appears to accept dr. flanner\\'s apology. it\\'s hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. ever more circumspect, dr. flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to adrienne. of course, while entertaining the natives in timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. evidently, apologizing to robert torrelson for his wife\\'s death was the second hardest thing. in the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more gere/lane sequels!',\n",

       " \"gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed . it is by far the movie of all movies . the romance between scarlett and rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons . one can ask , is it really necessary to make a sequel ? and ... there are some big shoes to fill .<br /><br />well , there was the book first . 'scarlett' by alexandra ripley is , we have to admit , well-written and fully respecting the world created by margaret mitchell . she picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy . in the book scarlett , defeated after melanie's death and rhett's leaving , travels to charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in hope of regaining rhett's love . her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from rhett and drives them further apart ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything . scarlett now carries a secret . the series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of scarlett in ireland . from then of , book and series slowly split ways . the actual end differs , but of course the both have scarlett and rhett back together .<br /><br />the production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next scarlett o'hara . many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part . eventually , about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in atlanta , georgia . unfortunately , the producer found no scarlett amongst these actresses . sad for the girls , major publicity for the show ( it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started ). robert halmi , the producer who bought the rights to 'scarlett' , told he discovered the right actress while watching tv , gave her a call and two days later signed the deal . joanne whalley-kilmer ( who starred in'willow' and 'scandal' , the latest being the movie robert halmi was watching that faithful evening )is not vivien leigh , but she certainly is scarlett ! her performance is not a copy of leigh's , she makes the character her own . the major difference between gwtw and 'scarlett' is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person . this is the series prerogative , why copying something that has been done before ? considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline , it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters . whereas mitchell works around scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for tara , ripley lets scarlett face her demons . this to me , is the most interesting aspect of the series , we get to know scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants . i totally agree with the choice of timothy dalton as rhett butler . he portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than clark gable's performance . the rest of the cast was well chosen . julie harris is endearing as rhett's mother , john gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather robillard and sean bean is always at his best playing a dirty character , his lord fenton makes no exception . poor choices however with stephen collins as ashley and ann-margret's adaption of belle watling was a waste of money . costumes , sets and locations are elaborate and convincing . the newly built tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time .<br /><br />is there a point in making a sequel ... well , six hours of romance are to me . one to watch !\",\n",

(a sleeveless regency evening gown? please! more versace than austen, that is sure) and poor keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! oh, and i\\'m sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. unfortunately, they didn\\'t catch him soon enough to comb the actresses\\' tresses before filming rolled.<br /><br />in short, with this new hollywood version, bid adieu to austen\\'s eloquence, subtlety and wit because you\\'ll be getting the complete opposite.',\n",

       " '\"talk radio\" is my favorite oliver stone movie, though he has made many great ones including \"salvador\", \"jfk\", \"natural born killers\" and \"platoon\". but i like the intimacy of \"talk radio\", a cinematic expansion of eric bogosian\\'s searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host. working with ace cinematographer robert richardson, stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse barry champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. alec baldwin, as his alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. ellen greene is fantastic as barry\\'s sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. john c. mcginley, as barry\\'s long-suffering screener/technical producer stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great michael wincott. the film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. the stewart copeland score is brilliant, too.',\n",

       " \"first, the obvious\\x97as a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama, quay \\x85 is disconcerting ,straightly independent and a menace to banality. jouvet's aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force; his antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct. quay \\x85 is not subversive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday's ) philistines enjoy using the word. it is clouzot's most playful hour. he tended to adapt steeman's books in a satiric note. (it's said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels.) as a director, clouzot's firm hand is successful. <br /><br />it is not a mystery or a thriller,but a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the police's proceedings. those accustomed with clouzot's masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things, styles, elements in quay \\x85.here clouzot speaks about many things, about a couple, and a hidden love story (simone renant's for blier),about the entertainment's world and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc.. there is a note of exuberance\\x97not only in jouvet's performance, but also in the film's conception. <br /><br />quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire. it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector. antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in africa ,but did not climb the ranks' stair because of his independent behaviors); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; at work, antoine is tough and merciless, an able inspector, bitter, intelligent and harsh. it is a role of great gusto, very picturesque. jouvet composed his character of several defining traits\\x97his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and that mocking air \\x85.antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible; when he interrogates blier, antoine makes mistakes ,and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real life\\x97mixed with errors and lacunae and defects. antoine's talent is one that comes also from experience, from daily observation\\x97it's not the almost supernatural _divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives.<br /><br />quay \\x85 is multifaceted\\x97it is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. one can consider it among the first _filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police. long ago eastwood's and wayne's harsh cops, there was antoine. <br /><br />the title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not about a case or a mystery. <br /><br />as craftsmanship, clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france (in the way that welles was). quay \\x85 is very true to clouzot's nature\\x97a sardonic comic, sharp observations, much psychology, sharp, unsparing irony. the man was first\\x97class when he filmed something\\x97he knew what to shoot, what to choose\\x97see the introductory scenes of this film, with jenny lamour's great stage success. each scene is memorably, _exemplarily shot. clouzot's technical, stylistic aptitudes were amazing. his style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely limpid, ingenious. <br /><br />jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (some disliked it precisely for these features. as he had been a great stage actor, his movie style was deemed as too theatrical, etc..) his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role, by a composition. <br /><br />jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy\\x97much like a menacing bird of prey\\x97somewhat like van cleef\\x97yet much subtler, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. jouvet had this predatory, ferocious air, and it is useful here, as he performs an old tough cop. one of quay \\x85's sides is that it is a jouvet recital. he is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his play (i see that many, watching this flick, do not know it is a jouvet movie\\x97which is an astounding quality in itself). <br /><br />fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most; the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama (the famous one), while jouvet by a carné comedy. i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of them.<br /><br />to end, a word about steeman; he wrote the novel used by clouzot (who had previously adapted another steeman novel, as a fresnay comedy). steeman was an old school mystery writer, in the wallace vein. he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions. when i was 11 i have read one of his thrillers, and liked it much.\",\n",

       " 'although little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (it\\'s rightly billed as a \"tabloid musical\") every sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history, since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screen\\'s most talented and beloved musical performers: deanna durbin and judy garland.<br /><br />although often cited as an screen test of sorts, produced by mgm to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractees durbin and garland whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal, this assertion is not entirely accurate. by the time every sunday was produced in july, 1936, deanna durbin\\'s contract with mgm had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by universal a month earlier, in june 1936.<br /><br />however, a provision in durbin\\'s mgm contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days, providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio. as durbin\\'s debut vehicle, three smart girls, was still not ready to begin filming, mgm chose to exercise its\\' option and, although officially under contract to universal at the time, durbin found herself back on the mgm lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful, judy garland.<br /><br />this, along with garland\\'s far more extensive prior professional performing experience/training (which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts), may explain why every sunday often seems to favor judy garland over deanna durbin, giving garland more lines to speak and an original song (\"americana\") to sing, while durbin offers the popular classical art song, \"il bacio\" by luigi ardiiti. certainly, it would make perfect sense that mgm would want to favor one of its\\' own contract players over another from a rival studio.<br /><br />ironically, although garland\\'s character is the more overtly pro-active one of the two girls in this short, it would be durbin\\'s feisty and impulsive \"little miss fixit\" screen persona at universal which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the world\\'s first \"teen idol\" with her debut vehicle, three smart girls, while garland\\'s more passive \"wistful wallflower\" adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner mickey rooney and (in ziegfeld girl) the up-and-coming lana turner. not until her fifteenth mgm feature, 1942\\' for me and my gal (which was also her first fully \"adult\" role) would garland achieve the solo above-the title billing and \"solo attraction\" status of a true superstar that durbin had attained instantaneously six years earlier.<br /><br />it is entirely inaccurate, therefore, to assert that garland was the only \"superstar\" attraction of the two girls, as durbin attained this status with press \\'n public, almost a decade before her mgm rival. literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing, the on screen evidence strongly suggests that universal was much quicker to realize deanna\\'s full superstar potential than mgm was with judy, and it\\'s worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment garland achieved at mgm, from superstar billing, to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal, to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of graumann\\'s chinese theater, to receiving an \"honorary\" oscar\" in recognition for her talent, deanna durbin received well before her gifted mgm contemporary.<br /><br />in any case, every sunday is a delightful, utterly unpretentious musical short. its plot line (durbin and garland use their singing talents to save durbin\\'s grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his sunday concerts in the park), presages the plot lines of both garland\\'s \"let\\'s put on a show\" musicals with mickey rooney and durbin\\'s 100 men and a girl. unlike garland\\'s later babes films, the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously, and consequently, its\\' eleven minute running time flies by.<br /><br />of course, the true magic of every sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talents/screen presences of durbin and garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers. both girls, even at this early stage, possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses. garland fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty \"americana.\" as she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures, judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do.<br /><br />by contrast, durbin\\'s presentation of \"il bacio,\" is far more demure and subdued. although entirely appropriate for her \"classical\" selection, durbin\\'s delivery of arditi\\'s waltz is much more of the traditional \"stand \\'n sing\" variety than garland\\'s physically emotive turn. nevertheless, though \"miniature diva\" deanna does nothing to call attention to herself, with her candid eyes, dazzling smile and artless delivery, she easily holds the screen with \"jazz baby\" judy, and their delightful duetting of \"americana\" in the short\\'s finale makes one regret all the more that producer joe pasternak was never able to realize his dream of pairing durbin and garland in a musical feature film (because universal refused to loan \"number one asset\" durbin out).<br /><br />a priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents. see this one if you get a chance!',\n",

       " 'this film by the well-known czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details. taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who\\'s trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old lucina (michaela mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic kuba (adam misik).the poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />marcela (anna geislerová), the beauty, and jarda (roman luknár) have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. there\\'s no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. his car-thief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes (josef abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jarda\\'s garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />\"beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/on whom she can rely,\" begins the graves poem. but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela, when he meets her at the police station. he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany, where he, though prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. he\\'s here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. benes\\' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn\\'t prevent jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, zdena (jana brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of zdena\\'s present husband, the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka (jiri schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn\\'t sexually abuse one or both of the children. he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own, and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies. improbable--perhaps implausible. why should benes like him? but then, what is benes\\'s whole story? about some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />clearly the \"good angel,\" benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing. it\\'s only at the end, when he\\'s pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won\\'t lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />also to be dealt with is jarda\\'s religious fanatic mother sdena (jana brejchova), and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch. but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief pal. if you revere hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. also included are a number of songs by glen hansard/marketa irglova of the oscar-award-winning irish musical film \\'once,\\' including the latter\\'s theme song, \"falling.\" they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from \\'once\\'--though this film came first.<br /><br />hrebejk\\'s people are arresting; even little koba has his shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. but such an elaborate demonstration wasn\\'t necessary. the acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and marcela\\'s conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. it\\'s fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to graves\\'s poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids. but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jarda\\'s annoyingly pious mother (emília vásáryová). how come all of a sudden we learn koba is getting letters from \"india\" purported to be from his dad, who\\'s in prison? when did that come about? interesting details, hastily pasted in. this seems a world in which you can\\'t see the forest for the trees.',\n",

       " '17/02/09 \"more\" (1969) dir: barbet schroeder <br /><br />for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, i\\'m impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. i\\'ve only scoured the web quite briefly and i\\'ve already been informed that \"more\" is: a 19th century-style romance, an allusion to the story of icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to pink floyd completists. it\\'s fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeder\\'s 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that \"more\" is anything but a pretty average film.<br /><br />neither is it a masterpiece, of course. i approached \"more\" as i did \"easy rider\" and antonioni\\'s \"blowup\" - as a \\'time-capsule\\' film, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. they all have similar flaws - either vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way - they are what they are, man. this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. thankfully, \"more\" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it.<br /><br />stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany. the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting estelle. the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza, against the advice of his friend charlie. this is where the icarus thing comes into play - she is the sun, he is pursuing her. you may now be able to guess how this all ends.<br /><br />ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over-populated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. i can\\'t think of many other films that have done this.<br /><br />the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings. for a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. but stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza.<br /><br />pink floyd\\'s score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of \"more\". it is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around estelle\\'s bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the soundtrack album\\'s front cover). a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple - they cannot \\'land\\' without a crash. maybe they\\'ve come too close to what they wanted.<br /><br />stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris. we are left to presume they have no idea where he is. while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears.',\n",

       " \"as talk-shows go, larry king live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. when bill maher, carl bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars. during the oj simpson trial, it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. but is this really journalism? or the national enquirer on the tube? sometimes, it comes off a little bit like trash television--jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.<br /><br />on the other side, king's show is definitely much better than bill o'reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the rush limbaugh variety. that said, larry king is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. king does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. always seems like the minute king can't quite deal with the issue at hand, that's when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. he might interview someone like david gergen, but may not have read any of his books. sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.<br /><br />when it's an entertainment celebrity, no problem. he can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science. and i notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie. watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. however, if it's the likes of john dean or bob woodward, king comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his homework. so off to the phones.<br /><br />if you are looking for real in-depth interviewing, terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states. she reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. i don't see king quite doing that. granted, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross, which may say more about the american audience than king. in short, larry is better than bill but not as good as terry.\",\n",

       " \"this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. this movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet.<br /><br />in sitting through this, i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line. the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes. her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.<br /><br />far from the brilliance of bruce almighty, evan almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god. yes, god was trying to influence politics.\",\n",

       " \"the film version of 'rising damp' came out two years after the television series ended. like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened. i came away bitterly disappointed. eric chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes. at the time of the film's release, the 'rising damp' series was still being repeated regularly on i.t.v. so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already. at least the 'on the buses' movies boasted original screenplays.<br /><br />secondly, richard beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of 'alan' as a mark of respect, substituting art student 'john', played by christopher strauli of 'only when i laugh' fame. it simply wasn't the same.<br /><br />as another poster has pointed out, rigsby's boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and altogether cleaner.<br /><br />director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'casino royale', a film steeped in surreal humour. 'rising damp' also has its share of 'walter mitty' style fantasy sequences, such as the 'saturday night fever' parody. personally, i found them horribly out of place. a case of 'over-egging the pudding'.<br /><br />on the plus side, leonard rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy 'rigsby', as are frances de la tour as 'ruth' and don warrington as 'philip. its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents.<br /><br />when rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by i.t.v. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste.\",\n",

       " 'in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of abu ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at guantanamo bay, gavin hood\\'s \"rendition\" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood. it\\'s not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.<br /><br />the term \"rendition\" refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law. anwar el-ibrahimi is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states. he has an american wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about.<br /><br />on the negative side, \"rendition\" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman, a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe anwar\\'s \"interrogation\" at the hands of egyptian officials. the problem is that, as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal, freeman seems too much of a naïve \"boy scout\" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn\\'t given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. we know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. he \"goes through the motions,\" but we learn precious little about the man within. thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. a similar problem occurs with anwar\\'s distraught wife, played by reese witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.<br /><br />what makes \"rendition\" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie\\'s closing stretches. it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is hollywood after all, and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.<br /><br />two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: omar metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and yigal naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer. meryl streep, alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion beebe.<br /><br />does the movie oversimplify the issues? probably. does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? most definitely. (one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were a terrorist). yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. it isn\\'t afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. it openly ponders the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of \"civil liberties for all\" in the face of terrorism and fear. and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say \"enough is enough,\" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (the movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism).<br /><br />thus, to reject \"rendition\" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. \"rendition\" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. and that alone makes it very much worth seeing.',\n",

       " 'the lone ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and i never missed a chance to catch his adventures on saturday morning re-runs during the mid 1950\\'s. somehow however, this film got by me until i had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library. i was struck by a number of elements during the story, as right from the start, you have a new lone ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the tv show. the adventure uses tonto (jay silverheels) in a nicely expanded role, even though he takes his share of lumps throughout, getting beat up and shot more than once. perhaps most interesting of all, the ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations, putting his character at odds with the vision created for the tv series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to wound or to protect himself and others. <br /><br />aside from that, you have a fairly traditional western adventure. the ranger and tonto come to the aid of an indian tribe whose members are being murdered by hooded raiders attempting to track down five medallions that together, form the key to a fabulous treasure. interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman, disarmingly portrayed by noreen nash. her top henchman is played by douglas kennedy, and it was no surprise to see lane bradford as one of the baddies. bradford\\'s character was one of the men shot by the lone ranger, which got me to thinking how many times that might have happened in the tv series. a quick check revealed that he appeared in \\'the lone ranger\\' show fifteen times, while kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /><br />what might be most interesting of all about the picture is it\\'s attempt to portray indians in a revisionist light at a time when tv and movie westerns were still largely portraying the red man as an illiterate savage. the character of dr. james rolfe (norman fredric) is the most revealing in that regard; he\\'s an indian who attained an education and went on to become a doctor, returning to the land of his tribe to tend to the needs of all it\\'s citizens. for purposes of the story, he had to impersonate a white man to be accepted by the local ranchers. this was the hardest thing for me to accept about the story line actually, as dr. rolfe was the grandson of the elderly chief tomache (john miljan). that no one in the story except paviva (lisa montell) knew that he was really an indian was something of a stretch for me. i suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age, but without that back story fleshed out, it didn\\'t make sense to me that no one else from the tribe would know who he was.<br /><br />i don\\'t know why i\\'m intrigued by this so much, but after watching and reviewing over two hundred westerns on this site, i\\'ve suddenly come across three films in the past month that utilize a blanket pull gimmick like the one performed by tonto\\'s horse scout in this picture. roy rogers\\' trigger did a similar stunt in 1952\\'s \"son of paleface\", and i caught it again in 1958\\'s \"the big country\" by a horse named old thunder in that flick. it\\'s done as a bit of comic relief in a situation that wouldn\\'t normally come up for a horse, and it now makes me curious when the bit might have been first done. i\\'ll have to keep watching more old time westerns. not to be outdone, silver had a chance to shine in the picture as well, making the save of an indian baby that was about to be used as a hostage by bad guy brady.<br /><br />speaking of gimmicks, clayton moore borrowed a tactic from the tv series when he donned a disguise as a southern gentleman to smoke out the villains posing as the hooded raiders. whenever he would do so in the half hour format, it was always clever enough to hide his real features, usually with a beard as done here. one of the more interesting episodes i recall had to do with the ranger impersonating an actor in the guise of abraham lincoln.<br /><br />keep an eye out for a couple of goofs i spotted along the way. in an early scene at the opening, an indian is shot by one of the hooded raiders, and in a close up, there\\'s blood on his shirt but no bullet hole. later on in the story, ross brady and wilson ride up on the indians after they\\'ve kidnapped one of the villains out of jail. brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but is immediately shown about to make his getaway on horseback with wilson.',\n",

       " \"'the english patient' can rightly be compared to the films of david lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'lawrence of arabia' and 'bridge on the river kwai' must have inspired the director anthony minghella. the film is beautifully photographed, and like 'lawrence', is set in northern africa, but during the second world war. the story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ralph fiennes and a married woman played by kristin scott thomas.<br /><br /> the story, based on a novel by michael ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by fiennes' count laszlo de almasy - the titular character. the fact that his name does not sound like he's english plays a key role in what unfolds. he has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in europe by hana, an army nurse played by juliette binoche. what makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. the film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. if you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'the english patient' speaks directly to you.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " 'first of all \"mexican werewolf in texas\" is not a werewolf movie. this title is bullcrap. the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas. i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. and i guess it actually works because that\\'s the reason why i bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. anyway the movie isn\\'t any good. actually it\\'s bloody awful. but i didn\\'t expect anything else when i bought it. it\\'s a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. but i must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.<br /><br />this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen. the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. they almost never say a line in a normal way. they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. it\\'s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. it\\'s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. she\\'s the worst of them all. i have never seen an actor as bad as her (and i\\'ve seen pteradactyl). even when her boyfriend dies she can\\'t stop being a bimbo about it. i hate her.<br /><br />some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. the gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. the effects are pretty hilarious really, but that\\'s the way i like it. the chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it\\'s easy to see that it\\'s a guy in suit.<br /><br />overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it\\'s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.',\n",

       " \"i know that the original psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, especially a shot-by-shot remake. i think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. but there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.<br /><br />the first problem is the color. the original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot after color film had been invented. the choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of hitchcock's. now, this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. the most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character. the bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrific events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.<br /><br />the second problem is the lighting. this is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the opposite direction. most of the scenes are very brightly lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at night!<br /><br />another obvious problem is vince vaughn's performance. yes, he does pull off norman bate's awkwardness and madness quite well, i don't deny him that. but there is one element to the character that he failed to show: the softness. there should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character, at least at first, which then fades away once we realize the truth about him. beyond being a character trait of norman bates, this is a recognized character trait of all psychopaths!!!!<br /><br />there are a few good aspects of this film. some of the performances are great. as i said, vince vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of norman bates. viggo mortensen and juliane moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. anne heche may have been atrocious but, unlike janet leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, anne heche was given last billing in the opening credits.<br /><br />i read on the cover of a copy of the psycho novel that gus van sant claimed this was not a remake of the hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. i now wish that i had bought that book and saved the comment because, after seeing this film, that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing i have ever seen. there was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be far more believable if van sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet zafroomulax. so many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. such as the scene in which sam and lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow. hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.<br /><br />in other words, my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said. like everyone else here, i reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.\",\n",

       " 'spoilers ahead.<br /><br />2001: a space odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late stanley kubrick. this is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind\\'s eye long after the movie itself is over. it is a film that you could meditate on.<br /><br /> the film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it\\'s ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself.<br /><br /> the first of the films four quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. we see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. the climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. an extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it\\'s presence to tool-making and violence. they are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. the new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. we see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. we soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. the characteristics inspired by the monument\\'s appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence.<br /><br /> once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it\\'s development. on an exploration of the moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. the governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. a mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with jupiter. a few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. the pilot of the spacecraft will be hal a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings.<br /><br /> the film has many outstanding sequences. as usual for kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. most memorable are \"blue danube\" and \"also spake zarathustra\" (particularly appropriate given the film\\'s theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) the cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film\\'s final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life.<br /><br /> the character of hal is the most important from the view of the film\\'s central thesis. in imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. the paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission\\' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. the film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution.<br /><br /> the architecture of the film is also meaningful. the designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. the ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed.<br /><br /> this movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of william butler yeats and james joyce\\'s novel finnegan\\'s wake. it posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it\\'s destiny is grand beyond it\\'s capacity to imagine. it continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard kubrick as a misanthrope.<br /><br /> this is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it\\'s invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it\\'s involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth. <br /><br /> in the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. hollywood\\'s view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. but kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. the process of making this film used all of his creative resources. the writing partnership with arthur c clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie\\'s astounding climax. the resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence.<br /><br /> 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.',\n",

yes, it's that bad. langley kirkwood, the actor playing orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. i'm sure he's still getting hassled by his friends.<br /><br />there isn't much to the plot. the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth, for some reason, and also, there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van dien's character, van helsing. most of the crew get turned into vampires, including van helsing, and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine. yeah, that's right, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. keeping in that baffling vein, one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires, or vampire, since there is really never more then one threatening them, is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such. what the? there are also references to god/religion being antiquated systems. but these references only confused me. did the soviet union make a comeback? is there some point roodt and milborrow want to make with this? it never really goes anywhere, seems dumb and the posters, etc. just look cheap.<br /><br />on the positive side, the film is competently shot and edited. the cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it's clearly done by professionals and, i had no problem with the special effects. the ships look like ships in outer space. although, as i write this, i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him. what were they thinking? why didn't someone say something? see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives? i guess, ultimately, that's the thing. whatever positives you try and grant this sci-fi/horror debacle, you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality.<br /><br />poor udo kier.\",\n",
       " 'in an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at john carpenter\\'s 1982 opus the thing, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director\\'s, howard hawks\\' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic the thing from outer space. although carpenter\\'s film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.<br /><br />in fact, carpenter\\'s film is less of a remake of hawks\\' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the john w. campbell story \"who goes there?\", in which a us scientific crew in antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. kurt russell, who had starred for carpenter in the director\\'s 1979 tv movie elvis and the 1981 film escape from new york, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including keith david, donald moffat, richard dysart, and richard masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing \"thing\", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. it isn\\'t long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. the ending of the film, in which russell and david are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both the birds and straw dogs.<br /><br />almost universally, when the subject of the thing is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by rob bottin, who had worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic the fog, and on joe dante\\'s 1981 werewolf film the howling. these effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. but all of this would make carpenter\\'s film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren\\'t up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. when he\\'s not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, carpenter builds suspense in the same hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films halloween and the fog, with cinematographer dean cundey\\'s prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. the acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by bill lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by ennio morricone, whose work on director sergio leone\\'s classic 1960s italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course carpenter himself. the thing also features additional fine visual effects from albert whitlock (who worked on many hitchcock films, including the birds), and roy arbogast, who worked on close encounters of the third kind and jaws 2.<br /><br />carpenter\\'s film was not the success it could have been because universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released steven spielberg\\'s far more family-friendly e.t.: the extra-terrestrial (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored spielberg\\'s excellent film over carpenter\\'s equally excellent but exceedingly different one). also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another spielberg-produced film, poltergeist. as a result, at a cost of $15 million, the thing suffered from lack of attention in its time.<br /><br />over time, however, many have come to see carpenter\\'s film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. though it is still quite gruesome, the thing should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.',\n",

       " 'i don\\'t watch very many \\'horror\\' movies, but one night i sat down and watched this with my cousins. now, we\\'re teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn\\'t very good, especially at the beginning. one line that stood out was when scarlett says to jill and tiffany, \"this is so... high school!\" while the next scene shows jill walking past a sign with their high school name on it... many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted lizzie mcguire episode. however, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only jill most of the time, i was able to appreciate the movie more. camilla belle did really well in this movie, and i think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. and i must admit, this was one of the scariest movies i\\'ve ever seen. well, no, there weren\\'t big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. and this movie really reminded me of what really is scary... we all know we\\'re not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you\\'re babysitting at could really happen. the only flaw with this movie is that it\\'s one of the most cliché movies i\\'ve ever seen. it has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc. at the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, i would give it a 7/10. it\\'s definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />by the way, this is my first review, so i don\\'t know if any of those things were spoilers.. but just to be safe...',\n",

       " 'i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. is that not what films are supposed to be about!? but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to. for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive, a lot can be learned from watching this film, technically it has everything going for it, the use of light, music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise. the actors performances are believable to a point, if not slightly under played, i felt there was much more in there, more depth, in particular from the male lead john paul clarke. but one thing that really does bother me, as a film maker myself, is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour? do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? or is this the future of wonderful, affordable film making?',\n",

       " '\"five characters in search of an exit\" clearly has to be one of the more clever and better \"twilight zone\" episodes ever made because of it\\'s abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise. you have a military major, a female dancer, bag pipe player, a clown, and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don\\'t know who they are. so the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds. plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity, and peace that\\'s very compelling for the viewer. only in the end i don\\'t want to spoil for those who haven\\'t seen a surprise fall happens! proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little sheltered world and be away from the masses of other people\\'s world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form. really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek.',\n",
       " 'an amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. brilliantly orchestrated in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. the acting was generally well-done (the \"director\" should\\'ve asked alec guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio). this movie didn\\'t let up since the opening scene...',\n",

       " \"this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. the strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare. as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park, shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. and, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night's eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film. all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham, another charming coming of age movie.\",\n",
       " 'i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. on the contrary, i was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. in 1969, the transition among african-american groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. it took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. special mention should be made of arnold johnson\\'s performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery. i\\'d rather watch this than \"to sir with love\" any old day!',\n",
